**Assemble!** a program greatly simplifying the preparation of molecular dynamics simulations of polymeric systems. It allows the creation of the desired system of polymer chains from constituent monomers, packs the chains into a box according to the required concentration and returns all the files needed for simulation with GROMACS. Assemble! is developed in Python, and can be controlled both via terminal and a graphical user interface.
